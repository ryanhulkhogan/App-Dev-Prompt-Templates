# Lightweight App Development Review Template

> This streamlined review template focuses on the essential aspects to check during app development. Use it after completing significant portions of work or before moving to the next development phase.

## Requirements Check

- Are we building what was originally planned?
- Have we added anything unnecessary?
- Are we missing any critical features?
- Does the current implementation solve the core problem?

## Code Quality

- Is the code organized logically?
- Is there duplicate or unnecessary code that should be removed?
- Are there performance issues that need addressing?
- What technical debt should we prioritize fixing?

## Security Essentials

- What feedback items should be prioritized?

## Next Steps

1. [Highest priority item to address]
2. [Second priority item]
3. [Third priority item]

## Lessons Learned

- [Key insight from this development phase]
